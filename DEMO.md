# Contract Upgrade Demo

This document demonstrates the working contract upgrade system.

## Demo Script
A script `scripts/demo_upgrade.sh` has been created to automate the following steps:
1.  Build Version 1 of the contract.
2.  Deploy V1 to Testnet.
3.  Initialize V1.
4.  Verify Version is 1.
5.  Modify source code to Version 2 (changing `get_version` to return 2).
6.  Build V2.
7.  Upgrade the deployed contract to V2 code.
8.  Verify Version is 2.

## Execution Log
Below is the output of running the demo script:
