//! # Bounty Escrow Events Module
//!
//! This module defines all events emitted by the Bounty Escrow contract.
//! Events provide an audit trail and enable off-chain indexing for monitoring

// ============================================================================
// Contract Initialization Event
// ============================================================================

/// Event emitted when the Bounty Escrow contract is initialized.
///
/// # Fields
/// * `admin` - The administrator address with release authorization
/// * `token` - The token contract address (typically XLM/USDC)
/// * `timestamp` - Unix timestamp of initialization
///
/// # Event Topic
/// Symbol: `init`
///
/// # Usage
/// This event is emitted once during contract deployment and signals
/// that the contract is ready to accept bounty escrows.
///
/// # Security Considerations
/// - Only emitted once; subsequent init attempts should fail
/// - Admin address should be a secure backend service
/// - Token address must be a valid Stellar token contract
///
/// # Example Off-chain Indexing
/// ```javascript
/// // Listen for initialization events
/// stellar.events.on('init', (event) => {
///   console.log(`Contract initialized by ${event.admin}`);
///   console.log(`Using token: ${event.token}`);
/// });
/// ```
#[contracttype]
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct BountyEscrowInitialized {
    pub admin: Address,
    pub token: Address,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

/// Emits a BountyEscrowInitialized event.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - The contract environment
/// * `event` - The initialization event data
///
/// # Event Structure
/// Topic: `(symbol_short!("init"),)`
/// Data: Complete `BountyEscrowInitialized` struct

    env.events().publish(topics, event.clone());
}

// ============================================================================
// Funds Locked Event
// ============================================================================

/// Event emitted when funds are locked in escrow for a bounty.
///
/// # Fields
/// * `bounty_id` - Unique identifier for the bounty
/// * `amount` - Amount of tokens locked (in stroops for XLM)
/// * `depositor` - Address that deposited the funds
/// * `deadline` - Unix timestamp after which refunds are allowed
///
/// # Event Topic
/// Symbol: `f_lock`
/// Indexed: `bounty_id` (allows filtering by specific bounty)
///
/// # State Transition
/// ```text
/// NONE → LOCKED
/// ```
///
/// # Usage
/// Emitted when a bounty creator locks funds for a task. The depositor
/// transfers tokens to the contract, which holds them until release or refund.
///
/// # Security Considerations
/// - Amount must be positive and within depositor's balance
/// - Bounty ID must be unique (no duplicates allowed)
/// - Deadline must be in the future
/// - Depositor must authorize the transaction
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```rust
/// // Lock 1000 XLM for bounty #42, deadline in 30 days
/// let deadline = env.ledger().timestamp() + (30 * 24 * 60 * 60);
/// escrow_client.lock_funds(&depositor, &42, &10_000_000_000, &deadline);
/// // → Emits FundsLocked event
/// ```

///
/// # Arguments

/// * `event` - The funds locked event data
///

/// Topic: `(symbol_short!("f_lock"), event.bounty_id)`
/// Data: Complete `FundsLocked` struct
///
/// # Indexing Note
/// The bounty_id is included in topics for efficient filtering

    env.events().publish(topics, event.clone());
}

// ============================================================================
// Funds Released Event
// ============================================================================

/// Event emitted when escrowed funds are released to a contributor.
///
/// # Fields
/// * `bounty_id` - The bounty identifier
/// * `amount` - Amount transferred to recipient
/// * `recipient` - Address receiving the funds (contributor)
/// * `timestamp` - Unix timestamp of release
///
/// # Event Topic
/// Symbol: `f_rel`
/// Indexed: `bounty_id`
///
/// # State Transition
/// ```text
/// LOCKED → RELEASED (final state)
/// ```
///
/// # Usage
/// Emitted when the admin releases funds to a contributor who completed
/// the bounty task. This is a final, irreversible action.
///
/// # Authorization
/// - Only the contract admin can trigger fund release
/// - Funds must be in LOCKED state
/// - Cannot release funds that were already released or refunded
///
/// # Security Considerations
/// - Admin authorization is critical (should be secure backend)
/// - Recipient address should be verified off-chain before release
/// - Once released, funds cannot be retrieved
/// - Atomic operation: transfer + state update
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```rust
/// // Admin releases 1000 XLM to contributor for bounty #42
/// escrow_client.release_funds(&42, &contributor_address);
/// // → Transfers tokens
/// // → Updates state to Released
/// // → Emits FundsReleased event
/// ```

///

// ============================================================================
// Funds Refunded Event
// ============================================================================

/// Event emitted when escrowed funds are refunded to the depositor.
///
/// # Fields
/// * `bounty_id` - The bounty identifier
/// * `amount` - Amount refunded to depositor
/// * `refund_to` - Address receiving the refund (original depositor)
/// * `timestamp` - Unix timestamp of refund
///
/// # Event Topic
/// Symbol: `f_ref`
/// Indexed: `bounty_id`
///
/// # State Transition
/// ```text
/// LOCKED → REFUNDED (final state)
/// ```
///
/// # Usage
/// Emitted when funds are returned to the depositor after the deadline
/// has passed without the bounty being completed. This mechanism prevents
/// funds from being locked indefinitely.
///
/// # Conditions
/// - Deadline must have passed (timestamp > deadline)
/// - Funds must still be in LOCKED state
/// - Can be triggered by anyone (permissionless but conditional)
///
/// # Security Considerations
/// - Time-based protection ensures funds aren't stuck
/// - Permissionless refund prevents admin monopoly
/// - Original depositor always receives refund
/// - Cannot refund if already released or refunded
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```rust
/// // After deadline passes, anyone can trigger refund
/// // Deadline was January 1, 2025
/// // Current time: January 15, 2025
/// escrow_client.refund(&42);
/// // → Transfers tokens back to depositor
/// // → Updates state to Refunded
/// // → Emits FundsRefunded event
/// ```
///
/// # Design Rationale
/// Permissionless refunds ensure that:
/// 1. Depositors don't lose funds if they lose their keys
/// 2. No admin action needed for legitimate refunds
/// 3. System remains trustless and decentralized
